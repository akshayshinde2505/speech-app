# Speech Synthesis Utterance
### [React JS (using Hooks)](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html, "React (Hooks)")

The SpeechSynthesis interface of the Web Speech API is the controller interface for the speech service.

---

**The code to start the speech synthesis :-**

```JavaScript
let utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Hello World!");
utterance.voice = window.speechSynthesis.getVoices()[1];
utterance.voiceURL = 'native';
utterance.pitch = 1;
utterance.rate = 1.5;
utterance.volume = 0.8;
utterance.onend = () => {
    // todo
};
window.speechSynthesis.speak(utterance);
```

Use `new SpeechSynthesisUtterance("Hello World!")` to initialize the synthesis.
